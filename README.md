<br>

## User Stories

<br>

Create a website that allows people to combine their passion for baking with their desire to connect with others, share knowledge and expertise, and potentially pursue entrepreneurial opportunities in the culinary/food industry.

<br>

## Developer

<br>

As a Developer I want to push myself and demonstrate my ability with different coding languages in combination.

<br>

## Design choices

<br>

#### Colours

In this project, the color palette, I chose, consisting of black, white, light grey, and dark grey evokes a sleek, modern, and sophisticated aesthetic. 

This combination often conveys a sense of professionalism, elegance, and minimalism. 

It may also elude to a theme of sophistication and refinement, appealing to users who appreciate clean and contemporary design. 

Additionally, it can create a sense of balance and clarity, allowing the *focus* to remain on the content, whether it's showcasing mouthwatering dessert images or providing insightful baking tips.

<br>

#### Typography

I used two fonts on this website for their combined effect; Lora and Times New Roman.

*   **Lora:** This is a serif font with a modern twist. Its graceful curves and balanced proportions provide a touch of sophistication while maintaining readability. Lora's versatility makes it suitable for both body text and headings.
    
*   **Times New Roman:** This is a well-known serif font that exudes tradition and professionalism. Its clean lines and distinctive letterforms make it highly legible, especially in longer passages of text. Times New Roman is often associated with formal documents and publications, giving the website a polished and authoritative feel.

Thus, by combining Lora and Times New Roman, one can create a harmonious typographic palette that enhances the overall visual appeal. Lora adds a contemporary flair, while Times New Roman brings a sense of familiarity and credibility, resulting in a refined and inviting user experience.

<br>

#### Imagery

Four images in total of the finished dessert of the given recipe can be seen on the website.

<br>

#### Site Structure

I have opted for a multi-page website as this offers flexibility, organization, and scalability, making it an effective platform for "Cook it" to showcase its diverse range of dessert recipes, culinary resources, and community engagement features to its audience.

<br>

## Version Control

<br>

I am definitly not happy with this project. I absolutely feel I had more to offer I had many great thoughts on how to improve my intial idea for the project. However a few of the final lessons on this part of the course were taught too fast which meant I had to review them several times. I found it was taught at 100mph (as did every student I found on slack!). Furthermore close to the deadline my computer was affected by a virus, which didn't let me start up my computer. I bought a new laptop to continue my project with a short amount of time remaining. I resigned to cut off the inclusion of a database and tried to refine and polish the code as best that I know. I have also tried to keep up with regular commitments.
